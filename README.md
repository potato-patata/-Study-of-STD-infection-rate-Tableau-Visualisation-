# Study-of-STD-infection-rate-Tableau-Visualisation-
1) Background and Audience:
STDs can have severe medical consequences, including death. Untreated gonorrhoea and chlamydia can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, or PID, in women, which can lead to infertility or chronic pain. There was an epidemic of STD from 1996 until 2008. Doctors and researchers were unable to provide proper medications and guidelines to the affected ones. The visualization is designed in order to make researchers understand the spread of disease over a region and to study the change in infection rate over years. To showcase this information, we have used variety of data sources and endeavoured to visualize it and provide insights about the Study of STD Infection rate.
2) Describing Data:
• Total number of records: There were 42631 number of rows with blank fields.
• Number of fields: 10
• Field names: Disease, Disease code, state, year, gender, age, age code, STD cases, population, rate per 100k.
3) Data Source:
The representation of data in a simple and effective manner is referred as data visualization by Andy Kriebel.
